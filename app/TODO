use enum instead of constant int/String pattern

popbackstack properly

work on constant strings (use little unique keys)

show bottom nav on playlists screen

In MainSharedViewModel communicate with fragments with LiveData

Make sure media id's are unique

Warning
    - make sure MediaSessionService's EXTRAS_BUNDLE is never null
    - SeviceMediaPlayback's player state shouldn't be Player.STATE_ENDED
    - Use commitNow with care
    - Make sure that button clicks trigger actions only once

Fix - local media not showing on first install
    - Back Press & ui transition lag
    - PlaybackState
    - Load data in proper order handle data properly
    - All EditTexts overflow
    - make sure Popbackstack removes the intented fragment
    - Check and fix memory leaks
    - Make sure inner classes are handled properly
    - Pictures(Bitmap, Drawable etc...) used every where

    - Write Unit Test
    - Reduce GPU Overdraw
    - Distinguish bottom nav elements by their size (the selected one is bigger than others)
